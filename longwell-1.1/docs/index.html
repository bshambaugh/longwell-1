<h1>Longwell</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>Longwell is a suite of web-based <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>
browsers.</p>
<h2>What can I do with this?</h2>
<p>You can browse and search arbitrarely complex RDF datasets using
different styles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an end-user friendly view (where all the complexity of RDF is
hidden)</li>
  <li>an RDF-aware view (where all the details are shown)</li>
</ul>
<p>But it's probably better if you <a
 href="http://simile.mit.edu/longwell/demo/tr/longwell">try it yourself</a>
and get a
feeling of what it is like.</p>
<h2>Why was it built?</h2>
<p>The SIMILE Project deals with applying <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">semantic web technologies</a> to
digital libraries and for the team needed a way to be able to browse
and search arbitrary RDF datasets, also to prototype different user
interface scenarios that could be useful to end-users, to digital
librarians and to metadata analysts.</p>
<p>While other RDF browser technologies exist (for example, the
outstanding <a href="http://haystack.lcs.mit.edu">Haystack Project</a>)
since the end goal of the SIMILE Project is integration with <a
 href="http://www.dspace.org">DSpace</a>, which is a server side
web-based application, we needed a web-based approach and a simple
architecture tuned to our needs that allowed us to prototype faster.</p>
<h2>Technology and Requirements</h2>
<p>Longwell is a web application written in Java that depends on the
following libraries for operation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/">Apache Velocity</a>
as the template engine</li>
  <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/">Apache Lucene</a> as
the search engine</li>
  <li><a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/">Jena</a> as the RDF
support library (parsing, storing, querying)</li>
</ul>
<p>and it has the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java 1.4</a> or later
compatible virtual machine for your operating
system.</li>
  <li>the JAVA_HOME environment variable must be set to the
installation directory of the java virtual machine in your system.</li>
  <li>[OPTIONAL] A Servlet 2.3 or later compatible application server.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">Longwell ships with a servlet container for easy
bootstrap,
but it can be installed in any servlet-compatible or J2EE application
server.</p>
<h2>Ok, I'm interested, now what?</h2>
<p>The best place to start is the Longwell <a href="guide.html">user
guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Where do I download it?</h2>
<p>You can obtain Longwell in two different ways:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>download a <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/dist/longwell/">prepackaged
distribution</a><br>
  </li>
  <li>download the files directly from the code repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>In case you want to download the files from the repository (for
example, if you want to have the latest and greatest development
snapshot), you need to have a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
client installed. At this point, just type</p>
<pre>svn co http://simile.mit.edu/repository/longwell/trunk/ longwell<br></pre>
<p>at the command line and the latest longwell distribution will appear
in the "longwell" directory.<br>
</p>
