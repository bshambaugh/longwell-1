<h1>Longwell User Guide</h1>
<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Longwell is a web application designed to let you browse and search
an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/">RDF</a> model,
especially when big (we use it for datasets that have 500k statements).
</p>
<p>Learning to configure Longwell to suit your needs requires some
basic knowledge of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a>
concepts as well as a familiarity with <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer" title="N3 Primer">RDF/N3
syntax</a>. Also, a reasonable idea of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">shape</span> of the data you plan on
browsing before getting started is helpful, at least the classes or
properties that you want to focus on: this dramatically increases the
usefulness of the browsing experience. </p>
<p>This guide provides information on where to find configurable
elements of Longwell and how to change their settings. </p>
<p>Longwell was designed to be configurable without requiring people to
write and/or modify its source code. </p>
<p>Also, in order to to help you understand how Longwell can fit your
needs and how flexible it can be, &nbsp; we ship it with a number of
example data bundles that come from very different domains. </p>
<h2><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>
<p>
Longwell is a web application written in Java and will run in any
J2EE-compatible servlet container or application server. For your
convenience, we have prepackaged one in the distribution and wrote
scripts to help you getting ready without hassle, even if you are not
familiar with Java application serving environments. On the other hand,
if you are, Longwell can be deployed into your existing servlet
container with ease.</p>
<p>The only requirement for Longwell is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
version 1.4.x installed on your operating system (we have not tried it
on a 1.5 JVM yet, if you do, let us know). If you don't have a JVM
installed, you can download one for free at the <a
 href="http://www.java.com/">Java main web site</a>.  Our build process
currently requires that you have a development kit version of the Java
toolset installed; anything other than a simple 'Java VM' installation
will suffice.  For example, try using the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">J2SE SDK 1.4.2</a>.</p>
<p>In order to get Longwell up and running with one of the example data
bundles that we ship, you can follow the following list of instructions:</p>
<ol class="steps">
  <li>Open your favorite shell/terminal on Unix/MacOSX or
command
line on Windows</li>
  <li><code>cd</code> to the base directory of the Longwell distribution</li>
  <li>Type <code>"./build.sh"</code> on Unix/MacOSX or "<code>build.bat</code>"
on Windows. </li>
  <li>Here the system will ask you to select a data bundle: type the
one you would like to browse. </li>
  <div class="note"> the 'art-private' data bundle is protected for
copyright
reasons and will ask you for a password.</div>
  <li>Type <code>"./longwell.sh run"</code> on Unix/MacOSX or "<code>longwell.bat
run</code>" on Windows.</li>
  <div class="note">depending on the choosen data bundle, longwell
might take
a while to start and during initialization time, the web application
won't be responsive.</div>
  <li>Once Longwell has stopped initializing, loading and processing
the data, point your browser at <a
 href="http://localhost:8080/longwell">http://localhost:8080/longwell</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If you know want to see another data bundle, do:
</p>
<ol class="steps">
  <li>Type <code>"./build.sh clean-webapp"</code> (this will clean the
webapp from
data)</li>
  <li>Start from step 4. above. </li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="ui"></a>The User Interface</h2>
<p class="figure"><img alt="Longwell Screenshot"
 src="images/main-screenshot.png" style="width: 667px; height: 570px;">
</p>
<p>The most important aspect of Longwell is the "faceted browsing" UI
paradigm.
</p>
<p>A <em>facet</em> is a particular
metadata field that is considered important for the dataset that we are
browsing. Since Longwell is a general-purpose browser, it has no notion
of particular metadata schemas, so the facets must be configured before
Longwell can browse a dataset.
</p>
<p>Once the facets are selected for a specific dataset (this is done
before running the web application) Longwell starts processing the
dataset and extracts a list of facets, their values and the number of
times this facet value occurs in the dataset. This is shown in the
right hand side, where each facet is boxed independently.
</p>
<p class="screenshot"><img alt="Facet Box" src="images/facet.png"
 style="width: 292px; height: 219px;">
</p>
<p>By clicking on a facet value, Longwell adds a facet restriction and
eliminates all items that do not fulfill that restriction. The facet
pane on the right is also updated, showing the facets and their values
that are available in that sub-dataset for further drill-down.
</p>
<p>When no more facet restrictions are possible, the right pane will be
empty.</p>
<p>Clicking on the right pane has the effect of "zooming in" the
dataset by locally removing from the view anything that it's not of
interest at that particular time. The user also has the ability to
"zoom out" by removing a restriction that was previously selected (top
right box).</p>
<p class="screenshot"><img alt="Restriction Box"
 src="images/restrictions.png" style="width: 329px; height: 105px;">
</p>
<p>The result of the restriction is a subset of the items available in
the dataset (what is considered "an item" is also a configurable
property of Longwell). Longwell can also be configured to display
particular properties of the items in various ways, and, mixing with
CSS stylesheets, it is possible to obtain pleasant presentations of
them, without having to modify Longwell's source code.
</p>
<p class="screenshot"><img alt="Item" src="images/item.png"
 style="width: 352px; height: 232px;">
</p>
<p>By clicking on any of the item
properties, the current restrictions are removed and the browsing is
then restricted to all items that contain that particular value in any
facet. At this point, further restrictions can be added by clicking on
the right pane.
</p>
<p>
Longwell also gives the ability to perform a "free text" restriction,
this reduces the browsed dataset to all items that contain the searched
strings in their properties values. This restriction is triggered by
entering text in the "free text search" box.</p>
<p>Also, since the different number of facet values can become very
large,
Longwell provides a "drill as you type" facet search field that is
used, in place, to spot the facet values of interest.</p>
<p>As you can see, all the RDF complexity is hidden to the user. This
is
done on purpose, since Longwell is aimed to be used by non-RDF-savy end
users, but for those who want to see "behind the scenes" and understand
the RDF model that backs up this data, you can click on the RDF icon of
any item to have a detailed RDF-centric view of the data you are
looking at.</p>
<h2><a name="data"></a>The Data Collection</h2>
<p>In order to make it easier for people to use and understand
Longwell, we ship it with a collection of freely redistributable
datasets, ontologies and data bundles.</p>
<h3>Ontologies</h3>
<p>Ontologies are used mainly to render resources with appropriate
labels and to indicate semantic information (such as equivalences or
subclassing) that drives the metadata inferencing. Many ontologies are
shipped in the Longwell distribution,
particularly <acronym title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</acronym>,
RDF Schema, <acronym title="Dublin Core">DC</acronym>, and <acronym
 title="Web Ontology Language">OWL</acronym>. Also we provide our own
for a number of datasets that do not have an official RDF ontology
available.</p>
<h3>Datasets</h3>
<p>Longwell ships with a number of RDF datasets or XML datasets with
conversion tools or scripts that convert them into RDF ones. For
up-to-date information on the available datasets and their origin,
consult the <a
 href="http://simile.mit.edu/repository/datasets/index.html">dataset
list</a> from the simile public repository.</p>
<h3>Bundles</h3>
<p>The SIMILE team believes that the power of the semantic web can be
unleashed when data can be reused "as-is" and combined in meaningful
ways. This is also called the "network effect" or "data synergy". In
order to show this, the Longwell build system was designed to have a
notion of a dataset, which is an organic database that originates from
a single group or entity and a bundle, an aggregation of datasets,
ontologies, configurations and optional "glue data" that makes it
possible to show the power of the semantic web in merging heterogeneous
metadata that was not designed, up front, to be joined and reused in
such a way.
</p>
<p>For up-to-date information on the available bundles and their
contents, consult the <a
 href="http://simile.mit.edu/repository/longwell/trunk/data/bundles/index.html">bundles
list</a> from the simile public repository.</p>
<h2><a name="browsing"></a>Configuration</h2>
<p>Longwell ships with pre-configured data bundled, but if you want to
use Longwell to browse your own RDF datasets, you need to configure it
with some data-specific configuration in order for it to be able to
operate.
</p>
<h3>Display Configuration
</h3>
<p>There most critical part to configure is the "display configuration"
that tells Longwell how to interpret the metadata (for example, what
are the facets) and how to visualize it (for example, if the value of a
property should be treated as a string, as a URL or as the pointer to
an external object, say, an image).
</p>
<p>This configuration is an RDF model and we found out that for writing
RDF by hand, the N3 syntax feels a lot more natural than the RDF/XML
one. The file is normally called <span style="font-style: italic;">config.n3</span>
and is located in the conf
directory of every data bundle (in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">data/bundles/*/conf</span> directory,
where * means the name of the bundle)
</p>
<p>Here is an example for a configuration file for the data bundle
about people (taken from the one shipped with Longwell and simplified a
little for readability):
</p>
<pre>@prefix dc:      &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .<br>@prefix rdf:     &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .<br>@prefix foaf:    &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt; .<br>@prefix rdfs:    &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .<br>@prefix disp:    &lt;http://simile.mit.edu/2004/02/ontologies/display#&gt; .<br>@prefix :        &lt;#&gt; .<br><br>:People a disp:BrowserConfiguration ;<br> disp:lang "en" .<br><br>:People disp:displayProperties (<br> foaf:name <br> foaf:nick<br> foaf:mbox<br> foaf:depiction<br> rdfs:seeAlso<br> foaf:homepage<br> dc:thumbnail<br> dc:description<br> foaf:plan<br>) .<br><br>:People disp:displayFacets (<br> rdf:type<br> foaf:knows<br>).<br><br>:People disp:displayClasses (<br> foaf:Person<br> foaf:Image<br>) .<br><br>:People disp:propertyObjectDisplay (<br> rdfs:seeAlso<br> foaf:depiction<br> foaf:mbox<br> foaf:homepage<br> dc:thumbnail<br>) .<br><br>rdfs:seeAlso a disp:Link .<br>foaf:depiction a disp:GetImage .<br>foaf:mbox a disp:Link .<br>foaf:homepage a disp:Link .<br>dc:thumbnail a disp:GetImage .<br></pre>
<p>The first part is composed by the prefixes, these indicate what what
URI those namespace prefixes are bound to in this particular RDF model:<br>
</p>
<pre>@prefix dc:      &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .<br>@prefix rdf:     &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .<br>@prefix foaf:    &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt; .<br>@prefix rdfs:    &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .<br>@prefix disp:    &lt;http://simile.mit.edu/2004/02/ontologies/display#&gt; .<br>@prefix :        &lt;#&gt; .<br></pre>
<p>The last line basically indicates that lack of prefix is bound to
the dummy URI. This is normally used to indicate that the data
contained in the RDF model is not really to be used in a semantic web,
but has just local meaning. At this point we are ready to tell our
story with this model, so the first statement<br>
</p>
<pre>:People a disp:BrowserConfiguration ;<br> disp:lang "en" .</pre>
<p>indicates that the concept <span style="font-style: italic;">:People</span>
is of type
<span style="font-style: italic;">disp:BrowserConfiguration</span>.
This will be used by Longwell to know that
this information should be used to configure itself.  It also indicates
that the default language selection, when faced with multiple language
options, is the language code "en."  The next group of
statements defines what properties should be presented to the UI:<br>
</p>
<pre>:People disp:displayProperties (<br> foaf:name<br> foaf:nick<br> foaf:mbox<br> foaf:depiction<br> rdfs:seeAlso<br> foaf:homepage<br> dc:thumbnail<br> dc:description<br> foaf:plan<br>) .<br></pre>
<p>In particular, this says that the <span style="font-style: italic;">dist:displayProperties</span>
for the
<span style="font-style: italic;">:People</span> browser configurations
are a <span style="font-style: italic;">rdf:List</span> and
that the items are the list of the values that
this <span style="font-style: italic;">disp:displayProperty</span>
assumes.<br>
</p>
<p>The next group of statements indicates what fields Longwell should
interpret as facets:<br>
</p>
<pre>:People disp:displayFacets (<br> rdf:type<br> foaf:knows<br>).</pre>
<p>Here, the two facets are <span style="font-style: italic;">rdf:type</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">foaf:knows</span>, which
basically
means that we are interested in the types of our data items and about
their <span style="font-style: italic;">foaf:knows</span> property.<br>
</p>
<p>But Longwell needs to know what data should be considered an item,
so here that's next:<br>
</p>
<pre>:People disp:displayClasses (<br> foaf:Person<br> foaf:Image<br>) .<br></pre>
<p>where these statements indicate that we consider first-class data
items in our datasets those of class <span style="font-style: italic;">foaf:Person</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">foaf:Image</span>, while
everything else is to be considered corollary information around them.<br>
</p>
<pre>:People disp:propertyObjectDisplay (<br> rdfs:seeAlso<br> foaf:depiction<br> foaf:mbox<br> foaf:homepage<br> dc:thumbnail<br>) .</pre>
<p>So, we have already identified the <span style="font-style: italic;">dist:displayProperties</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span> and this will make those
properties show up for the item in the order
listed, if they are available (keep in mind that RDF data tends to be
very semi-structured, so it's natural, when you aggregate data from
different sources, that some properties might not be there).<br>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, properties in <span style="font-style: italic;">disp:propertyObjectDisplay</span>
will be transformed to one of the options
(external link, fetched image, replacement image, etc.) as specified in
the configuration (see <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>below).&nbsp;
For this reason, properties in <span style="font-style: italic;">dist:propertyObjectDisplay</span>
should be a subset of those in <span style="font-style: italic;">disp:displayProperties</span>.
</p>
At this point, we have identified all the information that Longwell
needs to operate on the data level, but then we might want to add a
little more functionality by indicating how some of this information
should be treated:
<p></p>
<pre>rdfs:seeAlso a disp:Link .<br>foaf:depiction a disp:GetImage .<br>foaf:mbox a disp:Link .<br>foaf:homepage a disp:Link .<br>dc:thumbnail a disp:GetImage .</pre>
<p>so, an <span style="font-style: italic;">rdfs:seeAlso</span>
property should be considered a <span style="font-style: italic;">disp:Link</span>,
therefore displayed in a way so that users can click on it (in HTML
this translates into an <span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;a
href=""&gt;</span> tag), foaf:depiction should
be considered as a URL reference pointing to an image (in HTML this
will be translated into an <span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;img
src=""&gt;</span> tag), and so on.<br>
</p>
<h3>Bundle Configuration</h3>
<p>Each bundle has a configuration file that is used by the build
system to prepare the Longwell web application. This file is called <span
 style="font-style: italic;">data.properties</span> and it's found in
the root directory of each data
bundle. This is a Java properties file and follows the usual
"name=value" convention.<br>
</p>
<p>The most important configurations are the first three properties, here
is an example taken from the art-public bundle:<br>
</p>
<pre># list of datasets used<br>bundle.datasets = ocw,via,loc-tgm<br><br># controls the inferencing<br>inferencing = yes<br><br># dynamically allow addition of data by URI to the store<br>allowAdd = true</pre>
<p>the first properties indicate that three datasets (namely <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ocw</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">via</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">loc-tgm</span>) are used by this
bundle, the second indicates that
Longwell should perform inferencing upon loading the RDF models
contained in this bundle, and the third allows any user to add more
data to the model by providing a URI, modifying the UI slightly to
add a text box to the navigation interface..
</p>

<h4>Scuttering</h4>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://sw.deri.org/~aharth/">Andreas Harth</a> and
his work on <a href="http://sw.deri.org/2003/seco/">SECO</a> scutter, Longwell
can also 'scutter' (or spider) for RDF across the web based on
<em>rdfs:seeAlso</em> links.</p>

<pre># scutter properties<br>scutter.enabled = true<br><br># how many levels down to follow rdfs:seeAlso links; 0 for none at all<br>scutter.depth = 0<br><br># where to index the scutter internal model<br>scutter.indexPath = /WEB-INF/scutter-index</pre>

<h3>Dataset Configuration</h3>
<p>Each dataset contains a <span style="font-style: italic;">build.xml</span>
file that indicates some activity
that the build system has to perform on the dataset before being
included in the Longwell web application for it to load them when
started.
</p>
<p>This action could just do nothing (if the RDF is already there), or
it could do things like unpacking a zip file (in case the RDF is
compressed) or more complex things like running an XSLT stylesheet on
top of an XML file to generate an RDF/XML representation of it, or even
running a custom script/program to generate the RDF model from other
data.
</p>
<h2><a name="browsing_your_data"></a>Browsing Your Own Data
</h2>
<p>The Longwell build system was designed to be easily extensible so
that you can plug in your own bundles, datasets and ontologies.
</p>
<h3>Using the Longwell Build System
</h3>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">./data</span> directory of
the Longwell distribution is where all
the data is stored.
</p>
<p>If you have more than one dataset to merge, we suggest you to create
a bundle and then reference them from it.
</p>
<p>If you just want to browser one single dataset that you have already
in RDF, probably the easiest way is just to create your own bundle and
put those RDF files in the <span style="font-style: italic;">./data</span>
directory inside your bundle, they
will be copied over by the build system into the web application.
</p>
<h3>Modifying the Web Application Directly
</h3>
<p>Alternatively, you can ignore the build system entirely and work
directly with the Longwell web application. </p>
<p>At startup, Longwell looks for files with the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">.rdf</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">.rdfs</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">.owl</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">.n3</span> extensions in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">./WEB-INF/data/</span> folder of the web
application, so
it is enough that you place all the RDF files that you want Longwell to
load and it will.
</p>
<p>In any case, remember to modify the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">config.n3</span> file or Longwell might
not be able to show you anything.
</p>
<h2><a name="storage"></a>Data Storage</h2>
<p>Longwell can read and acquire data from several different types of
storage systems besides the bundling process described above. The
simplest method for data storage is through file bundles, but you may
have needs that a more advanced storage system can better meet. The
term "repository" will be used to indicate a storage system from here
on.
</p>
<h3>Alternate Repositories and Repository Configuration</h3>
<p>Currently, Longwell supports five different repositories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#store-jena">Jena</a></li>
  <li><a href="#store-joseki">Joseki</a></li>
  <li><a href="#store-kowari">Kowari</a></li>
  <li><a href="#store-3store">3store</a></li>
  <li><a href="#store-sesame">Sesame</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring Longwell to switch to a different repository requires
editing the <span style="font-style: italic;">data.properties</span>
file found in a bundle. All of the sample
<span style="font-style: italic;">data.properties</span> files provided
in the distribution contain all the key
/ value pairs allowed for configuration, so some of the core options
can be changed by uncommenting the desired line and commenting out the
default.
</p>
<p>The type of repository is determined by the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">repository.type</span> key (by
default, 'files'):
</p>
<pre>repository.type = files<br>#repository.type = database<br>#repository.type = kowari-memory<br>#repository.type = kowari<br>#repository.type = joseki<br>#repository.type = 3store<br>#repository.type = sesame<br></pre>
<p>The model used for querying the repository is given by the queryType
key (by default, 'JenaLocalAPIModel'):
</p>
<pre>queryType = JenaLocalAPIModel<br>#queryType = JenaLocalRDQLModel<br>#queryType = KowariLocalAPIModel<br>#queryType = KowariITQLModel<br>#queryType = JosekiRDQLModel<br>#queryType = ThreeStoreRDQLModel<br>#queryType = SesameRDQLModel<br>#queryType = SesameSeRQLModel<br></pre>
<p>Note that the correspondence between repositories and querying
models is not one-to-one; more than one querying model might be used
per repository.
</p>
<h3><a name="store-jena" ide="store-jena"></a>Jena</h3>
<p><a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/">Jena</a> can either read
files into memory or connect to a Jena-configured database. Use 'files'
for the in-memory repository generated by files, 'database' for any of
the databases.</p>
<p>These keys must be assigned values for the file-based in-memory
repository:</p>
<pre>repository.type = files<br><br>bundle.datasets = [comma-separated list of datasets]<br>inferencing = [yes|no]<br>queryType = [JenaLocalAPIModel|JenaLocalRDQLModel]<br><br># data path for file repository, relative to the webapp directory<br># by default, the path is WEB-INF/data<br>data.path = WEB-INF/data<br></pre>
<p>The database repository can be based on either MySQL, PostgreSQL, or
Oracle (though we at Simile haven't tested Oracle with Jena yet).
Installing, configuring, and running the database systems is not within
the scope of this guide, but more information can be found in the <a
 href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/DB/howto.html">Jena MySQL how-to</a>
and the <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/DB/postgresql-howto.html">Jena
PostgreSQL how-to</a>. You will need to initialize a user and a
database with the appropriate permissions. To function with Longwell, a
JDBC2 driver .jar for the particular database you want to use must be
deposited in the <span style="font-style: italic;">lib/repository/</span>
directory. Links to appropriate <span style="font-style: italic;">.jar's</span>
can be found in the Jena how-to documentation.</p>
<p>Data must be injected into the database in a form Jena will
recognize. To assist you, a Java command line tool was created. Found
in the tools package (<span style="font-style: italic;">edu.mit.simile.tools</span>),
LoadDb takes the the
database type, filename, database name, model name, and username as
arguments:</p>
<pre>% [~/longwell/trunk] ./tools.sh LoadDb MySQL mydata.rdf triples mydata myusername<br><br>or<br><br>C:\longwell\trunk\&gt; tools.bat LoadDb MySQL mydata.rdf triples mydata myusername<br></pre>
<p>These keys must be assigned values for the database repository,
depending on which specific database is used:</p>
<pre>repository.type = database<br><br>queryType = [JenaLocalAPIModel|JenaLocalRDQLModel]<br>database.type = [MySQL|PostgreSQL]<br><br># MySQL config options, for database.type = MySQL<br>mysql.classname = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver<br>mysql.database = [name of database]<br>mysql.user = [username of database user]<br>mysql.password = [password of database user]<br>mysql.model = [name of model]<br><br># PostgreSQL config options, for database.type = PostgreSQL<br>postgresql.classname = org.postgresql.Driver<br>postgresql.database = [name of database]<br>postgresql.user = [username of database user]<br>postgresql.password = [password of database user]<br>postgresql.model = [name of model]<br></pre>
<h3><a name="store-joseki" id="store-kowari"></a>Joseki</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.joseki.org/">Joseki</a> can be run as a remote
repository. There is a <a href="http://www.joseki.org/publishing.html">quick
guide</a> to publishing a Joseki repository available to cover the
installation, configuration, and running of a Joseki instance. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">joseki .jar</span> is distributed with
Longwell.</p>
<p>Your model must support RDQL queries (in the Joseki configuration,
you should have your model with <span style="font-style: italic;">'joseki:hasQueryOperation
joseki:BindingRDQL'</span> as one of the statements). Record the base
URI from
which your model is being served, then use it as the value of the
joseki.uri key:</p>
<pre>repository.type = joseki<br><br>queryType = JosekiRDQLModel<br>joseki.uri = [joseki model URI]<br># e.g., joseki.uri = http://localhost:2020/mymodel<br></pre>
<h3><a name="store-kowari" id="store-kowari"></a>Kowari</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.kowari.org/">Kowari</a> can be run with Longwell
as either an in-memory repository or a remote repository. The in-memory
repository does not require Kowari to be running in a separate instance
and is akin to running with Jena in 'files' mode. Files will be loaded
from the specified data path.</p>
<p>Kowari's .jar's are not distributed with Longwell. Place
<span style="font-style: italic;">driver-1.0.3.jar</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">trove-1.0.2.jar</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">activation-1.0.2.jar</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">saaj-1.1.jar</span>,
and <span style="font-style: italic;">jrdf-0.2.1.jar</span> in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">lib/repositories/</span> directory after
successfully running Kowari. The latest version tested with Longwell
was Kowari 1.0.3.</p>
<pre>repository.type = kowari-memory<br><br>queryType = KowariLocalAPIModel<br>data.path = WEB-INF/data/<br>kowari.model = [kowari model URI]<br># e.g. kowari.model = &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#sampledata&gt;<br></pre>
<p>To set up Kowari as a remote repository, see the <a
 href="http://kowari.org/1139.htm">Kowari Installation Guide</a>. After
setting up Kowari, use the model URI in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">kowari.model</span> key. Be aware
that Kowari's model URI depends on the hostname of the machine it runs
on; you may find it easier to run in an environment with static domain
names.</p>
<pre>repository.type = kowari<br><br>queryType = KowariITQLModel<br>kowari.model = [kowari model URI]<br># e.g. kowari.model = &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#sampledata&gt;<br></pre>
<h3><a name="store-3store" ide="store-3store"></a>3store</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.aktors.org/technologies/3store/">3store</a> is
an RDF-aware repository based on MySQL and written in C. In our
experience, 3store works best with MySQL 3.x, though your experience
may differ. You can download it from its <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/threestore">Sourceforge project</a>;
it also has dependencies on the <a href="http://librdf.org/raptor/">Raptor
RDF Parser Toolkit</a> and <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache
HTTPD</a> (any version). You will need to compile 3store with the
<span style="font-style: italic;">--enable-http</span> option to allow
queries to 3store over Apache. If you are
working with large datasets and expect large results from queries, you
may need to set a higher DEF_MAX_COMP value (defined in
<span style="font-style: italic;">src/http/mod_3store.c</span>, default
to 1000 estimated results). The 3store
Java driver used in Longwell was written by Simile and is distributed
with Longwell.</p>
<p>Once 3store is running in concert with Apache, determine the URI
Apache is configured to serve RDQL requests from (you may have set it
yourself in the Apache configuration files) and use it as the
<span style="font-style: italic;">3store.uri</span> key value.
</p>
<pre>repository.type = 3store<br><br>queryType = ThreeStoreRDQLModel<br>3store.uri = [URI of 3store model]<br># e.g. 3store.uri = http://localhost/rdql/<br></pre>
<h3><a name="store-sesame" ide="store-sesame"></a>Sesame</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.openrdf.org/">Sesame</a> runs as a remote
repository from any servlet container. The <a
 href="http://www.openrdf.org/doc/users/index.html">Sesame documentation</a>
describes configuration using the <a
 href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a> servlet container.
Sesame can use its own in-memory repository or MySQL, PostgreSQL, or
Oracle as data repositories. To set up the Sesame repositories, you can
either edit the application configuration or run the configuration
tool. You can then load data into the repository through Sesame's web
interface. The <span style="font-style: italic;">sesame .jar</span> is
not distributed with Longwell. It must be
acquired along with the Sesame distribution. Place sesame.jar in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">lib/repositories/</span> directory
after successfully running Sesame.</p>
<p>Determine the URI from which Sesame is being served, and locate
which repository you want to query data from and use them as values of
the relevant keys.
</p>
<pre>repository.type = sesame<br><br>queryType = [SesameRDQLModel|SesameSeRQLModel]<br>sesame.uri = [URI of sesame instance]<br># e.g. sesame.uri = http://localhost:8080/sesame/<br>sesame.repository = [name of sesame repository]<br># e.g. sesame.repository = rdbms-rdf-db<br>sesame.user = [sesame username]<br>sesame.password = [sesame password]<br></pre>
