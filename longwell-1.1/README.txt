  What is this?
  -------------

  Longwell is a suite of web-based general-purpose metadata browsers based on
  Semantic Web technologies (RDF/RDFSchema/OWL).



  Requirements
  ------------

  Longwell is implemented as a Java servlet, therefore you need
  the following things installed on your machine:

   o  A Java 1.4 or later compatible virtual machine for your operating system.

   o the JAVA_HOME environment variable must be set to the installation directory
     of the java virtual machine in your system.

  NOTE: this distribution comes with a minimal servlet engine (jetty) so you 
  don't need anything else to try it out, but you can install longwell 
  into any J2EE compliant application server if you have one running already.



  How do I try it out? 
  --------------------

  This distribution contains everything you need to start run the browsers. To do that
  just follows these steps:

   1) open your favorite shell (or command line on windows)
   2) cd to the directory where this file you are reading is located
   3) type "./build.sh" ('build.bat' on windows)
     [here the system will ask you to select a data bundle]
   4) type "./longwell.sh run" ('longwell.bat run' on windows)
   5) point your browser at http://localhost:8080/longwell

  That's it! Enjoy!
